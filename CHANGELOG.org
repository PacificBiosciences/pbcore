* Version 1.0.0
- BAM fixes
- Better FOFN handling
- Recognize additional part numbers for P6 chemistry
- Better --debug in ToolRunner

* Version 0.9.5
- BAM fixes
- Adopt aStart, aEnd conventions from BAM spec, replacing rStart, rEnd
- AlnIndex sharing among CmpH5Reader objects

* Version 0.9.4
- BAM support moved to 3.0 spec; support for earlier PacBio BAMs
  dropped
- Deprecation warning decorators added
- BAM-incompatible cmp.h5 accessors deprecated
- Moved to support 3.0 FASTA conventions in Fasta readers
- Rename FastaTable to IndexedFastaReader

* Version 0.9.3
- ".open" script added for convenience
- openers added (factory methods invoking the appropriate Reader
  class; useful for applications that want to transparently use either
  BAM or cmp.h5)

* Version 0.9.2
- BAM support: Addition of BamReader, IndexedBamReader, and BamAlignment
- Minor CmpH5Reader API changes for greater compatibility with
  BamReader (deprecation of movieInfo in favor of readGroupInfo)
- Removed unused components from CmpH5Reader API
- Add example BAM file
- Length accessors for FAST[AQ] record types

* Version 0.9.1 (SMRTanalysis 2.3.0p1)
- FASTA header parsing into "id" and "metadata" now available in the
  FastaRecord types

* Version 0.9.0 (SMRTanalysis 2.3.0)
- pbcore.chemistry: a new subpackage for decoding barcode information
  to the human-readable chemistry name
- BasH5Reader: more robust handling of broken region tables
- CmpH5Reader: loading an empty cmp.h5 will raise an EmptyCmpH5Error.
  This is because the semantics of an empty cmp.h5 were never defined,
  and for example it is not defined whether or not a cmp.h5 lacking a
  movie table is compliant.
